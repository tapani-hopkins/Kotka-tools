Trap site description:
Tall closed canopy primary forest on a mild slope towards the river. Red clay underfoot. Fallen trees allowed some light to reach the forest floor, resulting in a lush undergrowth around the trap and large amounts of decaying wood. The trap was next to a large fallen tree (Fagara macrophylla 48cm diameter).

Original trap site description (verbatim as written in Uganda 2014): 
Trap by large fallen tree trunk (quite solid wood), CC slopes. Fairly closed canopy except round trap where fallen tree has opened the canopy a bit.Trap spans a passage in the undergrowth which crosses the trunk, and is touching the trunk at one end, Quite a few insects were flying along this route. This is also waypoint 187: CC slope. Lots of tall trees of varying kinds, but also fallen trunks and a surprising amount of light reaching the ground. As a result, also lots of saplings and undergrowth - some of the plants I haven’t seen elsewhere. Some insects flying, and there was also a kääpä (bracket fungus?) with flies landing and mating.

Trap site description:
Tall closed canopy forest on a mild slope towards the river. Red clay underfoot. Low light and little undergrowth. Trap was next to a sizeable tree (Olea capensis 239cm diameter, not Mimusops as originally identified, with strangler figs starting to grow in the canopy)

Original trap site description (verbatim as written in Uganda 2014): 
CC slopes next to a large Mimsops tree. There is a path of sorts downslopes (Westish) of the tree, and the tree has a long root buttress running along one side of the path - the trap spans this path and touches the buttress on one side. Quite shaded, Afromamum undergrowth. This is also waypoint 189: CC slope. Huge Mimsops tree with a long root buttress (must stretch at least 4 metres from tree). Quite a bit of shade plus a bit of Afromamum and isolated saplings. Fallen branches too. Looks like a good site for the trap downslope (west) of the tree, where there is a path-like passage running along the slope and the buttress guides insects in.
